# Getting Started with Create React App

## Note::: 
I have used npx create-react-app to create this application and below are the scripts used 
to launch the application in dev env(http://localhost:3000). I have removed some the files which comes along when 
installing new create-react app. 

* `Node` - 6+ is supported, 12.18.0 is recommended
Please start first with installing modules using yarn install.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## The exercise

__Goal__: Production of a client-side Web application to help a child understand multiplication.

__Duration__: This test is intended to take ~2 hours but may take more

__Description__: The application will display a grid of all the numbers from 1 to 144 evenly laid out with a large clickable box around each number. The number should be centered in each box. When the child clicks a box then all the numbers which are a multiple of that number should be highlighted in some way. Clicking on a second number removes the highlighting of the previous selection, then highlights the multiples of the newly selected number.

__Constraints__: On mobile devices the grid will display 1 number per row. On tablet devices 2 numbers per row and on desktop and larger devices 3 numbers per row. The numbers should fill their rows equally. When the screen width grows very large a margin should appear either side of the grid so that the boxes don’t keep getting larger.

You do not need to use any libraries but if you do, you should be able to explain the reasons for your choices in the Readme file.

If there is any information that you feel is missing from the story then please make sensible decisions (for example it’s up to you how you define ‘mobile’, as long as it’s sensible, similarly please define highlighting).

__Criteria for assessment__: Important things that will be assessed are:

* Project layout.
* Coding style, i.e. your approach not whether you use semicolons or not ;)
* Your approach to unit testing/TDD
* Maintainability and extensibility
* Use of responsive design
* Performance, Accessibility and use of Semantic HTML
* Naming conventions used
* Meeting the requirements

The test won’t be assessed on design at all, so don’t worry how it looks.
